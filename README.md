T-CEP-Alert
===========

Author: Dan Ruscoe (dan@ruscoe.org).

This is an Android application which displays alert updates from the Topanga Coalition for Emergency Preparedness (T-CEP.)

The official T-CEP website can be found here: http://t-cep.org/

This application is entirely unofficial and built because I wanted T-CEP alerts on my phone.
